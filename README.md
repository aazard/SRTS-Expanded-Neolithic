# SRTS-Expanded-Neolithic
An expansion mod for SRTS Extended, it adds a Neolithic SRTS craft option, starts unlocked.  Slightly better than walking. Like a very slow and low range (max 20 world map tiles) drop pod.  Adds a single SRTS craft, a Cody type lifting box kite, able to hold 1 pawn, plus 35kg of cargo.  A Super Low Tech (A big "Sky Lantern") Tribal or Neolithic, wood/cloth "Drop Pod". Its "fuel" (repairs) is wood logs.  ================ Requires SRTS Expanded: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1845423808&amp;searchtext=srts ================
